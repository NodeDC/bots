* Nodebots Day Houston
  It's a cool event with robots and JavaScript, it should have a cool webpage.

  It will eventually live at [[http://bots.nodejshouston.com/]] but for now, you
  might be better off checking [[https://nprescott.com/public/nodebots/]] while we
  prep the rest of the content.

** Goals
   My real goal here is to keep things lightweight. It's a simple landing page
   with (presently) 2 images and *no webfonts* coming in at around 200kb
   total. All of the styling happens in about 20 rules of CSS.
